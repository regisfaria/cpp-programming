# C++ Programming
  
## Overview  

I'm signing up for mentoring at my College, where I will assist Computer Engineering students to program in C++.

So this repository is the result of the study I'm doing for the selection exam.

## Installation & Running

To build run one script, you can use:

```shell
g++ main.cpp -o main
```
*where `-o` tells that the output file will be called `main`*

Then you can execute it with:

```shell
./main
```

In addition, you can execute both commands in one line, with:

```shell
g++ main.cpp -o main && ./main
```
*this will both compile the .cpp file and right after it, execute it.*

## Progress

I'm following courses of giraffe academy to remember the language. 

Here I'll write where I've stopped at the video, so I can track progress
